Problems, Journey and Solutions

Problem: 
GPU kept running out of RAM, unable to train model effectively as OOM error kept appearing
Journey: 
Explored multiprocessing in python, GPU "per_process_gpu_memory_fraction" configuration and cuda reset. 
Multiprocessing and GPU does not work, memory still remain high. Cuda reset will erase the data in gpu, but crashing the system too.
Solution:
Resetting Keras session worked, with:
    sess = get_session()
    clear_session()
    sess.close()
    sess = get_session()
